# Evolved Neighborhood Simulation


Built in Matlab. Simulation of Kenrick, Li, and Butner (2003) in which neighborhoods full of hostile and peaceful individuals change based on a "majority rule".

The rule was called “majority rule” and it said: for each person in the neighborhood, look at their nearest
neighbors (including diagonals) and count up how many hostile and peaceful neighbors they
have. If they have more hostile than peaceful neighbors, then that person also become hostile. If
they have a majority of peaceful neighbors, then they become peaceful. If they have an equal
number of hostile and peaceful neighbors, then they don’t change.
